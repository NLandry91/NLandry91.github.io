intro:
  - excerpt: "I'm an applied math PhD student with a penchant for thinking
              about the &quot;why&quot; with a good grounding in common sense. I am
              analytical and like to see the bigger picture. I've worked in
              both academia and industry and am passionate about the next
              hard problem that comes my way. I love learning and my
              [portfolio](/portfolio/) shows some projects that I've worked on
              professionally, in research, and for fun."

Originally a New Englander, I live with my wife, Shari, in Boulder, CO. I'm a PhD student in Applied Mathematics and was originally a mechanical engineer. In my free time, you can find me perfecting my homemade ramen recipe, reading, taking long walks, programming, engaging in philosophical discussions, or exploring the outdoors.
