# About Me

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/hike_pic.JPG" width="50%" hspace="20" align="right">

I'm a New Englander at heart; I grew up in Seacoast NH and got my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering at the University of New Hampshire. Post graduation, I took a break[^fnote1], then worked as a [Manufacturing Engineer][2] for several years. Mathematics has always been my passion, however, so I returned to school to get a doctorate in [applied mathematics][3] at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

I live with my wife, Shari, in Boulder, CO and in my free time, you can find me perfecting my homemade ramen recipe, reading, programming, engaging in philosophical discussions, or exploring the outdoors.

[^fnote1]: After graduating from UNH, I stayed at [L'Abri][1] in Huemoz, Switzerland, where I spent several months studying philosophy amidst community living in the Swiss Alps.
