# About Me

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/hike_pic.JPG" width="50%" hspace="20" align="right">


I'm a New Englander at heart, growing up in Seacoast NH and getting my
Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering where I wrote my undergraduate thesis on
[efficient microstructure data representation][1].
Post graduation, I took a break[^fnote1], then worked as a
[Manufacturing Engineer][3] for several years. Math has always been my primary
passion, however, and I returned to school to get a doctorate in
[applied mathematics][4] at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

[^fnote1]: After graduating from UNH, I stayed at [L'Abri][2] in Huemoz, Switzerland, where I spent several months studying philosophy amidst community living in the Swiss Alps.
