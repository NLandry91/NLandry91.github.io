This is a list of network science books curated by some fine folks on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nwlandry/status/1343676490366390272). Note that some of these aren't quite network science related but interesting nonetheless! This isn't an exhaustive list so feel free to email me any other suggestions to add!
