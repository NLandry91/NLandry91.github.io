# World Cup Passing Networks

I got really interested in the structural characteristics of the network of passes in a soccer game. I used [WebWeb][1], an excellent Python package developed by Hunter Wapman and Dan Larremore at CU Boulder, to visualize these networks. I used the StatsBomb [database][2] on Github for the game data.

Look at the visualization of the [2019 FIFA Women's World Cup][3] and the [2018 FIFA Men's World Cup][4]. You can also check out my Github [project][5] to use the GUI to analyze other datasets in this format.
