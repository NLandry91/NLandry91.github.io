# Portfolio

Here is a summary of some of the projects I've tackled in the last few years. I have eclectic interests so the subject matter is wide ranging. It's my belief that well-roundedness is important, so I'm always trying to learn new things and explore different areas. Please [contact me][1] if you have a particularly interesting project that you're working on.
